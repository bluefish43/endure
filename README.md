# The `endure` language

This is an experimental language, and features may change
abruptly. Use this at your own risk.

## Goals

In type checking and AST

- [x] Declaration of functions;
- [x] Declaration of namespaces;
- [x] Search of elements within the current namespace;
- [x] Generic functions (templates);
- [ ] Use of elements from outer namespaces; and
- [ ] Importing namespaces from an include path.

And for a more general look:

- [x] Implement code generation with LLVM.
